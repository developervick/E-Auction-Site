#### If the User logged in
Its an complete online Auction system, where people can register themselves and create listing to sell their item,
       For their item they can set starting bid, its title, detailed description, category and can upload its Photo,
       along with this they can browse all the listing and currently active listings placed by other users,
       user can also browse listing by category. 
       And users are able to place bid on other users listing, user who posted listing can not place bid on it.
       Any user can add any listing to their watchlist to track it later,
       users can interact with other users in comment section of each listing,   
       Also user can close the listing posted by him,
       once the listing will close It will declare highest bidder as a winner and he will not be able to reactivate it.

#### If the user is anonymous (not logged in)
      User can only view all the listing, and all the active listings only,
      also user can view listing by category in category section.
      And rest of features will only accessible if user is logged in,
      if some how user tries to access them he will redirect to login and registration page.

##### ** Still their is room to add much more functionalities in the system but for demonstration purpose these are enough.**
